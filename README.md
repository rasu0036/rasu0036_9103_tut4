### 1 Imaging Technique Inspiration
- __Geometric Generative Art as Inspiration__
I am inspired by part of Steve's Makerspace generative artworks, which main composed of geometric shapes and are rich in texture. The abstract compositions provide strong visual contrast through the interplay of shapes and textures. The technique makes the works visually striking, which aligns with my project goals.
- __Incorporating vairety of visual expressions in p5.js__
Iâ€™d like to incorporate the use of **buffer canvas** to enhance visual expression of the original image by adding layered textures, patterns, or other effects. This technique from the inspiration will increase visual contrast and depth, helping me to create a unique design that aligns with my project goals. To meet the assignment requirements, I can present the original image in a completely different way but still retain the original features by exploring special textures, color coordinates, and other techniques and using them through buffer canvas.

### 2 Coding Technique Exploration
- __Related coding technique__
The main coding technique for the inspiration is the **buffer canvas**. It is an off-screen graphics layer where you can draw independently from the main canvas so this technique can assist in implementing textured geometric art by independent layering and manipulation of shapes. The method createGraphics() is used to create a buffer canvas. 
- __Enhancing Visual expressions with Buffer Canvas__
Steve uses buffer canvas to create his artwork, as it allows layering and manipulation without affecting the main canvas. Given the assignment requirements, this approach is beneficial because it provides layering flexibility, enabling manipulation of specific elements without affecting the entire canvas. I aim to divide the image into several editable parts to create a **visually layered**, **semi-stereoscopic** effect for making the designs more engaging while maintaining simplicity. The edits on the buffer canvas can be applied without changing the base layer so we can more easily try design elements such as textures, patterns and effects to individual elements.
